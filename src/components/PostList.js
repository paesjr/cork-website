        'Introducing Glynn, our loyal customer from Taranaki who is back for more with his stunning 42" timber slick cork bodyboard and a trusty pair of Vektor fins. Featuring eye-catching inlays of Redwood and Paulownia, this board is not only high-performing but also a work of art - its design even inspired by Glynn himself! With its undeniable beauty, it could easily double as a wall decoration. We are thrilled to see Glynn enjoying his board and can not wait to see where his next adventure takes him.',

        "A laser engraved Horseshoe crab on a cork bodyboard heading to NY üá∫üá∏ with a set of Vektor fins. Horseshoe crabs can be observed at many beaches and parks in NYC. Horseshoe crabs are marine and brackish water arthropods of the family Limulidae and the only living members of the order Xiphosura. Despite their name, they are not true crabs or crustaceans; they are chelicerates, most closely related to arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions. Wikipedia",

      content:
        "A small army of the VOW blades have recently arrived in Australia. Check them out ! vowboards.com.au The shape of the Blade is specifically designed for performance, from channels on the bottom to help hold your line in the heaviest of waves, to thumb/grip grooves on the deck for comfort and easier handling in the water. The curved rail profile allows for you to not only set your line, but also to release and adjust whilst on the wave to optimise your ride. The bat tail adds a little extra surface area to help with your lift and also allows you to choose which arm your leash goes on. ",

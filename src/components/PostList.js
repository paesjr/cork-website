        'Introducing Glynn, our loyal customer from Taranaki who is back for more with his stunning 42" timber slick cork bodyboard and a trusty pair of Vektor fins. Featuring eye-catching inlays of Redwood and Paulownia, this board is not only high-performing but also a work of art - its design even inspired by Glynn himself! With its undeniable beauty, it could easily double as a wall decoration. We are thrilled to see Glynn enjoying his board and can not wait to see where his next adventure takes him.',
